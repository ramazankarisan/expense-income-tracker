## Expense Tracker Project

-   In this project I will be practicing CRUD operations via this [API](https://expensetracker-be.herokuapp.com) and you can find its documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11347698/TzRPiote).
-   In this project, basically anyone who can access theirs interface, can do the **CRUD** operations. I will be using _HTTP Methods_ for these operations via using endpoints from the above given API.
-   users can reach out to their accounts and add/delete/edit expense categories and track them.
-   Maybe I can turn the procedures of Database in to **Firebase** in the future.
